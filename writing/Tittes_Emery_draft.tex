\section*{Introduction}

% The journal does not have numbered sections in the main portion of
% articles. Please refrain from using section references such as
% section~\ref{section:CountingOwlEggs}, and refer to sections by name
% (e.g. section ``Counting Owl Eggs'').


% Please note that we prefer (\citealt{Xiao2015}) to \citep{Xiao2015},
% since \citep{} inserts a comma after "et al."

(\citealt{morrissey_variation_2016})

% Appendix A, B, and C), these will become three separate online PDFs.
% You may wish to consolidate these into one PDF (hence one section,
% divided into subsections as necessary). Please reset counters for
% each such section.

\subsection*{Fox--dog encounters through the ages}

The quick red fox jumps over the lazy brown dog. The quick red fox has 
always jumped over the lazy brown dog. The quick red fox began jumping 
over the lazy brown dog in the 19th century and has never ceased from so 
jumping, as we shall see in 
%figure~\ref{Fig:Jumps}.

% Figure legends
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Please include all figure legends in a separate section at the end of 
% the document. If you use \label{} and \ref{} to refer to your figures,
% these can still work even if you comment out the %includegraphics{}
% line. If you refer to figures as "fig. 1" (etc.) manually, the
% legends can also appear simply as paragraphs.
% For submission, please upload the relevant figure files separately to
% Editorial Manager; Editorial Manager should insert them at the end of
% the PDF automatically.
% Figure legends should be concise, though they can be longer than the
% titles of tables.
